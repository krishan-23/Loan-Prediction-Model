#Loan Prediction
Loan prediction models are typically trained on a dataset of historical loan data. This data includes information about the loan applicants, such as their credit score, income, and debt-to-income ratio. It also includes information about the loans themselves, such as the loan amount, interest rate, and repayment period.

Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the likelihood that a new loan applicant will repay their loan. This information can be used by lenders to make lending decisions and to set interest rates.

Loan prediction models can help lenders to improve their lending practices and to reduce their risk of loss. They can also help to make the lending process more fair and equitable
